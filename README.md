# Solar Data Analysis Project

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing how different environmental measurements affect a country's potential for solar installation. By employing statistical modeling, we aim to provide actionable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers. 

## Business Objective

The primary goal is to study how solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction along with cleaned and soiled radiance sensor (soiling measurement) affect the potential for solar installation.

## Situational Overview

As an analytics engineer at MoonLight Energy Solutions, a consultancy firm specializing in data-driven insights for the energy sector, the analysis aims to:
  * Identify key events affecting Brent oil prices over the past decade.
  * Measure the impact of these events on price changes.
  * Provide clear, data-driven insights to guide investment strategies and policy development

## Data

The dataset includes environmental variable records from August 9, 2021, to August 9, 2022 capturing the full annual cycle in the fields
  * GHI (W/m²): Global Horizontal Irradiance, the total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.
  * DNI (W/m²): Direct Normal Irradiance, the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the rays of the sun.
  * DHI (W/m²): Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun.
  * ModA (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (A), similar to irradiance.
  * ModB (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (B), similar to irradiance.
  * Tamb (°C): Ambient Temperature in degrees Celsius.
  * RH (%): Relative Humidity as a percentage of moisture in the air.
  * WS (m/s): Wind Speed in meters per second.
  * WSgust (m/s): Maximum Wind Gust Speed in meters per second.
  * WSstdev (m/s): Standard Deviation of Wind Speed, indicating variability.
  * WD (°N (to east)): Wind Direction in degrees from north.
  * WDstdev: Standard Deviation of Wind Direction, showing directional variability.
  * BP (hPa): Barometric Pressure in hectopascals.
  * Cleaning (1 or 0): Signifying whether cleaning (possibly of the modules or sensors) occurred.
  * Precipitation (mm/min): Precipitation rate measured in millimeters per minute.
  * TModA (°C): Temperature of Module A in degrees Celsius.
  * TModB (°C): Temperature of Module B in degrees Celsius
